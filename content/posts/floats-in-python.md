We are going to start by looking at the internal representation of float. 

How are floats represented in Python?

**The float class is Python's default implementation for representing real numbers**. So when you type `a = 10.1`, then the default class that is used by python is called a **float**. 

Now there are other ways to represent real numbers such as decimal class.

/* Detail missing about Decimal Class */

You don't need to worry about the difference between integers and floats, Python takes care of it for you.
An integer can be represented as a whole number with a positive or negative sign.
 
`-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3` --> These are some examples of integers.

Floats are used to store nonwhole number (What you probably know as Rational numbers in Mathematics).
