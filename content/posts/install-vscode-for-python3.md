**Prerequisite** - [Installing Python on your machine](https://www.pylenin.com/blogs/installing-python-for-windows/)

Although, you can learn to code in the [Python Interactive session](https://www.pylenin.com/blogs/installing-python-for-windows/#step-6-hello-world) on your command line, you should use an **Integrated Development Environment(IDE)** for writing your Python code.

In this article, you will learn to install Visual Studio Code(VS Code) for Windows 10. However, you can use this process for any operating system.

#### Step 1 - Download Visual Studio Code 

Visit the [website of Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). It will automatically show you the right `exe` file for your operating system. Click on the **"Download"** button.

Your `exe` file will be downloaded and you will be redirected to a **"Thank you for downloading VS Code"** page.

#### Step 2 - Installing VS Code

Click on the downloaded `exe` file and it should open up the installer.

Check **"I accept the agreement"** and click on **"Next>"**.

You can choose to create a Desktop icon and **add VS Code to your PATH**. Make the choices you want and press **"Next>"** and then press **"Install"**.

Once the installation finishes, you will see the successful installation page. When you click on **"Finish"**, VS Code Editor will be launched.

#### Step 3 - Write your first program

Open VS Code and click on **"File"** and then **"Open Folder"**. For the purpose of this tutorial, we will create our python files inside a `trial` folder present in Desktop.

In the `trial` folder, create a new python file called `test.py`.

Write your first Python code `print("Hello World!")`.

**However, you won't be able to run your code.** 
You need to understand that VS Code works like a simple text editor. It has no built-in support for Python.

To run Python code, you need to **download the Python extension for VS Code**.

#### Step 4 - Download Python extension for VS Code

Click on the **Extension button on the left hand menu bar**.

The **Marketplace for VS Code Extensions** should open up. Search for **python** in the search bar.

Choose the Python extension provided by Microsoft and click on **"Install"**.

Now when you go back to your `test.py` file, you should be able to see a **Run button**.

Once you click on the **Run** button, your Python code will be successfully executed.
