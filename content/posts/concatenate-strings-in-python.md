Concatenation is joining of two or more strings into a single string.

In Python, the `+` operator is used for concatenation. 
You can also concatenate two strings by writing them together.
Another way is to use the `*` operator to repeat the string for a given number of times.

**Code**

```python3
str1 = "I like "
str2 = "Pylenin"

print(str1+str2)

print(str1, str2)

print(str1*2)
```

**Output**

```bash
I like Pylenin
I like  Pylenin
I like I like 
```
