Tick Tock, Tick Tock!

The clock is ticking. We are nearing the end of Python 2. At the time of writing this blog, approximately 6 months 20 days and 2 hours are left for Python 2.7 to retire. Don't believe me? Check out the [Python Clock](https://pythonclock.org/). 

The buzz has already been there for a while now. If you are an active python programmer(no matter which level), you probably already know that Python 2 is soon going to become obsolete. Probably a lot of your friends, colleagues and people in the Python community have already suggested you to move on to Python 3. If you haven't done it yet, too bad. You should really be listening to your well wishers more. But probably you haven't done it for a reason. May be you are too proud of your old code base. They still fulfill a purpose. Sentiments, Right? I know. But the truth is none of your sentiments are going to be helpful after **January 1, 2020**. Yes, that is the official date. You will be left behind and all your work would have been for nothing. 

Moreover, you have been missing out on a lot of stuff. In this blog, I am going to demonstrate all the advantages of using Python 3 that you have missed out if you are still stuck with python 2. I am also going to share some strategies to port your code to the latest version without going through a migrain or trouble while sleeping.

#### Differences between Python 2 and 3

Python has become one of the famous programming languages in the world. Its simplicity, readability and an active online community that not only supports the new comers in different ways but are also actively building python libraries to cover various aspects of our life are some huge reasons why the popularity of Python is justified.
