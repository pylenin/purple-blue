Over the years, Python has become one of the most popular programming languages. It has its application in [many fields](https://www.pylenin.com/blogs/5-reasons-to-learn-python/). Installing Python is the first step towards becoming a python programmer in 2021.

In this article, you will learn to install Python 3 on windows. Since 2020, Python 2 has already become obsolete. The whole world has switched to Python 3 and for [all the right reasons](https://www.pylenin.com/blogs/10-benefits-of-switching-to-python-3/).

This article will show you how to install Python 3.9(the latest version) and start programming using the command line interface.

#### Step 1 - Visit [Python official website](https://www.python.org)

Visit the [official website](https://www.python.org) of the Python Programming language and click on **Downloads**.
