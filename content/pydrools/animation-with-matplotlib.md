I have been a Python developer for 4 years and I never gave a hoot about building animations or gifs in Python. I mean, why would I? Who has this much of free time? Not me for sure !! But yesterday, I came to realize it’s value.

I was building a Business Intelligence Report for the Monthly Meeting of our company. I wanted to show them the increase/decrease in our orders over the last 1 year. There comes our trustee Matplotlib library. Oh Yes !!

I had an amazing graph and everything looked good. But then something occurred to me.

> **What if I can animate this thing and explain the seasonality in our orders??**

That would be amazing, right? But I don’t know how to animate in Python. So I started going through the Matplotlib documentation and some articles over the internet…. [And look what I built !!](https://giphy.com/gifs/python-matplotlib-mDGDm5XKLWDxme0Q8Q)

If you think that’s the graph of our company’s orders, then Sorry, it’s not !! I can’t show you classified information. But the concept still applies to every situation. Check out the source code [here](https://github.com/pylenin/Pydroolers).

Here are some additional resources to understand animations with the Matplotlib library.

1. [Matplotlib Documentation](https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/api/animation_api.html)
