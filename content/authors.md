I am a Data Engineer working in Amsterdam and the founder of Pylenin. I also have a [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/pylenin) where I post videos about python topics, data engineering, competitive coding interview questions and a lot of other things. 

I intially started this as a hobby to improve my knowledge in Python and share it with other people. However, it has caught on slowly and now we are making this platform a hub of talented people all over the world to share their knowledge in the field of Python. 

Do suggest us how to improve and tell us what you want to learn. We will surely provide you with all the materials you want.
